# Discle
Are you a Wordle and disc golf fanatic? Then this is the game for you.

This app is built with Ruby and Sinatra and is a dynamic webapp so it is not hosted anywhere. Apparently you just have to pay money to make software public these days. I am slowly working on a version built with JS instead of Ruby to get out on the web.

The gameplay flows as follows:
- A disc name is displayed

- The player enters their guessed flight numbers

- Any flight number that is correct will appear green

- A hint at the bottom shows if the speed of the disc is higher or lower than the guess

The player has 4 guesses to correctly guess the flight numbers before the game ends.

Then you press Play Again and the addiction begins...
